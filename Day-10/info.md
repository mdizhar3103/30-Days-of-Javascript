## Working with Javascript Modules

Using IIFE help in hiding from global scope

**Modules**
- Import and export keywords
- Encapsulate code
- Control access
- Reference its own dependencies
- Modules are singletons that means when we import module everything that are imported will get the same instance of it
- Properties are bound 
- Exports are static, once you defined what are being exported you can change it later at runtime, once it loaded it stays how it is.
- One module per file
