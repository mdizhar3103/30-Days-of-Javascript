Starting development server:

- Rest Parameters ( func (...parameters){} )
- Destructuring Arrays
- Destructuring Objects
- Spread Syntax
- Controlling Loops (break, continue keywords)

**Functions and Scope**
- IIFE's (Immediately Invoked Function Expression): Function wrapped in braces
- Closures
- this keyword
- call(), apply(), bind() - main purpose of __call__ is to change the value of this which is context of function, __apply__ is similar to call but we can pass array of arguments to apply, 
- Arrow Function: Arrow functions don't have their own `this` value. `this` refers to the enclosing context.
